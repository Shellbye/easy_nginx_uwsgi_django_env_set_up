easy_nginx_uwsgi_django_env_set_up
===================


I have setup several django site based on nginx and uwsgi, and it seems that there are more and more coming, so write down this script initially based on [this article][1].

----------




> **Note:**

> - Your uwsgi file need to be in ini file if you want to use this script up to now.




----------


Usage
-------------------

First change the file permission:

`chmod +x nginx_uwsgi_django.sh`

And then run it

`./nginx_uwsgi_django.sh`

You may need to follow the flow to input some file names or directory names.
